# Secure Engineering Skill Pack

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A focused AI skill pack for evidence-driven implementation, secure design, dependency and privacy review, operational readiness, safe migrations, release decisions, and authorized defensive security review.

## Included Skills

### `modular-evidence-implementation`

Use for feature implementation, bug fixes, refactoring, architecture boundaries, repository evidence, focused tests, and oversized mixed-responsibility files.

### `release-readiness-evidence`

Use before staging or production release, deployment approval, migration or feature-flag rollout, capability-boundary validation, rollback, recovery, and `Go` or `No-Go` decisions.

### `authorized-security-review`

Use for defensive, authorized review of authentication, recovery, authorization, administrator actions, tenant isolation, abuse controls, sensitive data, and scoped security testing.

### `threat-modeling-lite`

Use before implementing security-sensitive features to identify assets, entry points, trust boundaries, abuse cases, controls, tests, and residual risk.

### `supply-chain-and-dependency-review`

Use when adding or upgrading packages, SDKs, CI actions, build scripts, Docker images, registries, signing, and release-pipeline components.

### `data-privacy-review`

Use when collecting, storing, logging, exporting, deleting, analyzing, uploading, or sharing user and sensitive data.

### `observability-and-incident-readiness`

Use when production workflows need logs, metrics, traces, alerts, dashboards, runbooks, containment, rollback, recovery, and data repair.

### `migration-and-rollback-review`

Use for database, schema, data-format, queue, cache, configuration, storage, protocol, and mixed-version rollout changes.

## Why Focused Skills?

Each skill has a narrow trigger and loads detailed `references/` only when needed. This reduces over-triggering, keeps agent context focused, and allows each skill to be installed or used independently.

## Installation

Copy each desired directory from [`skills/`](skills/) into the target tool's skill directory.

### Codex

User-level:

```text
$HOME/.agents/skills/
```

Repository-level:

```text
<repo>/.agents/skills/
```

Example:

```text
.agents/skills/
├── modular-evidence-implementation/
├── release-readiness-evidence/
├── authorized-security-review/
├── threat-modeling-lite/
├── supply-chain-and-dependency-review/
├── data-privacy-review/
├── observability-and-incident-readiness/
└── migration-and-rollback-review/
```

### Claude Code

Personal:

```text
~/.claude/skills/
```

Project:

```text
.claude/skills/
```

### Cursor, Trae, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot

Add the relevant `SKILL.md` as a project rule, workspace instruction, agent rule, or custom instruction. Keep its `references/` directory available when the tool supports referenced files.

## Verify Installation

Run the repository validator:

```bash
python scripts/validate_pack.py
```

Then try the task in [`examples/quickstart.md`](examples/quickstart.md). Confirm the agent selects the relevant focused skills, distinguishes evidence from assumptions, reports validation actually run, and does not claim unsupported release readiness.

GitHub Actions runs the same validator for pushes and pull requests.

Every skill directory contains a short `SKILL.md`, optional `agents/openai.yaml`, and detailed guidance in `references/`.

## Shared Resources

- [`shared/review-mode.md`](shared/review-mode.md): High-signal PR review output focused on blocking issues, risk, maintainability, tests, security, and release concerns.
- [`shared/output-contract.md`](shared/output-contract.md): Standard evidence-based completion report.
- [`examples/`](examples/): Good and bad examples covering unsupported claims, false validation, over-splitting, release blockers, and unauthorized testing.

## Core Principles

- Verify repository evidence before implementation claims.
- Keep business ownership and dependency boundaries explicit.
- Keep handwritten source files at or below 800 physical lines.
- Stop repeated bug trial-and-error and research authoritative sources.
- Treat skipped, unknown, and untested release checks as not passing.
- Never treat client-side visibility as authorization.
- Perform active security testing only with explicit authorization and scope.
- Treat data minimization, dependency provenance, observability, and migration recovery as engineering requirements.
- Never claim code is fixed, secure, tested, or ready without evidence.

The 800-line limit is a deliberately generous review trigger, not a claim that every file over 800 lines is inherently wrong. Detailed rationale, exceptions, and team-level customization guidance live in the modular implementation reference.

## Examples

- “Implement this feature with clear module ownership and focused tests.” Use `modular-evidence-implementation`.
- “Decide whether this build is ready for production.” Use `release-readiness-evidence`.
- “Review authentication and registration abuse risks in this authorized environment.” Use `authorized-security-review`.
- “Identify threats before implementing this billing webhook.” Use `threat-modeling-lite`.
- “Review this dependency and GitHub Actions upgrade.” Use `supply-chain-and-dependency-review`.
- “Review how this AI feature handles user data.” Use `data-privacy-review`.
- “Verify this service can be detected and recovered during an incident.” Use `observability-and-incident-readiness`.
- “Review this database migration and rollback plan.” Use `migration-and-rollback-review`.

Start with [`examples/quickstart.md`](examples/quickstart.md) for a complete before-and-after example.
